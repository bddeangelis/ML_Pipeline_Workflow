# ML_Pipeline_Workflow

The files contained in this repo demonstrate the use of sklearn.Pipeline and sklearn.GridSearchCV in a simple Multilayer Perceptron example. The PipelineModel class is just a wrapper over the Pipeline class in sklearn which defines some methods for loading and saving data in a desired format.  To train a single model one can run the script contained in pipeline_model.py. Alternatively, a grid search of model parameters can be performed using parameter_sweep_script.py.
